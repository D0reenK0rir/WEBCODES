         <h2>THE MASAI MARA AND MARA CONSERVANCIES</h2><br>
            <p>Masai Mara is one of Africa’s little known gems and should be on the itinerary of all lovers of wilderness and solitude. Famous for hosting the great migration of 1.5 million wildebeest and its large lion population, the landscape is incredibly diverse with the rest of the big 5,elephant,buffalo,rhino and leopard, are also a common sight.
                Hot-air-balloon over the Masai Mara and watch wildlife glide beneath you, giving you a different perspective of this beautiful landscape.It is a personal favourite for those of us in the Tourice Travels office.
